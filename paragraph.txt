Sarah discovered an unusual package on her doorstep one rainy Tuesday morning - a worn leather suitcase with no identifying marks except a small brass tag engraved with the coordinates to a location in rural Montana. Intrigued and unable to resist the mystery, she called in sick to work, threw the suitcase in her trunk, and began the twelve-hour drive north, her mind racing with possibilities. During her journey, strange coincidences kept occurring: every radio station seemed to be playing the same obscure jazz song from the 1940s, and she repeatedly spotted a red vintage Corvette that appeared to be following her, only to vanish at each rest stop. When she finally reached the coordinates at sunset, she found nothing but an old drive-in movie theater, abandoned for decades - yet as she parked her car, the ancient projector mysteriously flickered to life, and what she saw on the screen changed her understanding of her family's history forever.
