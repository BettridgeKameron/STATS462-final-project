With only using the letter transition probabilities and nothing else this approach was able to successfully decrypt random substitution ciphers that were long enough about more than 50 words where longer was better It also worked fairly well for both English and Tagalog however it did struggle with things where the text may not align with the languages standard probabilities such as Song lyrics since they may repeat words a lot that may incorrectly increase the probabilities of specific letters I believe that this could be solved by using other techniques such as frequency analysis finding better values for iteration Zipfs law or other common cryptanalysis techniques
